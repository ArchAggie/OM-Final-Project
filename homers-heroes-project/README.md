## Ready To Roll Up Your Sleeves and Volunteer With Team Depot?  

##### As you know, one our core values is "Giving Back". We were inspired to create this project to bring more awareness to our store associates surrounding the many projects and partnerships we have to reinforce our outreach. Homer's Heroes makes it easier for store associates to create new projects in their community, and rally our heroes to join in. This application makes that process simple and efficient!
